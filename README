Tie::DB_File::SplitHash

 Designed for support of file size limitted OSes. Transparently splits 
 a DB_File database into as many distinct files as desired. Distributes
 hash entries between the files using a randomization algorithm. 
 Has the effect of allowing DB_File hashes to grow to the full size 
 of the partition. Requires 'Digest::SHA1' and 'DB_File' to be installed.

To install:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install
